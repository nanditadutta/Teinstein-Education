# Teinstein-Education
The questions is assigned by teinstein education for the coding assessment for the 2nd round.
The Code is contributed by Nandita Dutta.
The Version Used for solving the assessment is python version 3.8.5.

#Task 1
---
Write a Python programs to check if the entered number is an Armstrong number.
--> The solution of this program is solved using the logic of armstrong Number.
(An Armstrong number is a number wherein the sum of the cubes of the digits is equal to thenumber itself )

#Task 2
---
Write a Python program to read a file and change the day specifiers like today, tomorrow and yesterday to the dates they correspond to and generate a new .txt file with the said output.You will be given sample input files and sample output files.
(The .txt file will be given as an input to the program. The .txt file will contain the date on which thefile was published and an excerpt from an article from that date. You need to match the publishing date with the system date and if the publishing date doesn't match the system date, you need tochange the day specifiers(today, tomorrow and yesterday) to the date the correspond to. )
Eg. Publishing date: 01-05-2021 System date: 05-05-2021
Input text: "Today the weather in the area will be sunny and tomorrow there is a chance of rain."
Output text:"On 01-05-2021 the weather in the area will be sunny and on 02-05-2021 there is achance of rain."
---> The solution of the program is sloved using the basic concepts of file opening, reading and writing.

#Task 3
---
Create a cryptography method of your own using python.
(Create a menu driven cryptography program which asks for user's input on whether toencrypt/decrypt and then asks for user's text. Depending on the mode it will generate an output text.Read up on different cryptography methods and try to invent one of your own methods. Thisquestion will be judged on your creativity and originality of the method.)
